        <h2>Problems of Me and Indian Culture</h2>
        <h3>Sex and Cultural Issues</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Sex is heavily advertised but remains taboo in India.</li>

            Key Problem: You’re mentally replaying the cycle: Awareness → Guilt → Urge → Release → Regret → Repeat. Even after seeing the whole game, you can’t stop pressing play. That’s not lack of knowledge. That’s addiction and emotional weakness. Unless you gain emotional and sexual control, your white fetish will rule you. Porn will continue to neuter your masculinity. You’ll keep talking big but living small.

        <h2>Decision Making Power & Judgment</h2>
        <h3>Job Options Considered</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>McDonald’s: Flexible hours.</li>
            <li>Cleaner: 8-hour shifts on Sat/Sun, 8 AM–4 PM, 5 hours sleep possible.</li>
            <li>Prob Security: Mon/Tues overnight, Sat/Sun 11 PM–11 AM.</li>
            <li>Iron Horse: Mon–Thurs overnight, 11 PM–7 AM.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Approaches</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1st: Ask Iron Horse for part-time Wed/Fri/Thurs.</li>
            <li>2nd: Ask Prob for Fri/Sat overnight.</li>
            <li>3rd: Risk McDonald’s and cleaner job, get G2, combine Prob (32 hrs), Cleaner (16 hrs), McDonald’s (8 hrs) = 56 hrs/week.</li>
            <li>4th: Leave Prob, do Iron Horse, McDonald’s, and cleaner.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Final Decisions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Left McDonald’s due to stress and toxic environment.</li>
            <li>Left cleaning job.</li>
           IDs            <li>Turned down Iron Horse due to strict supervision.</li>
            <li>Chose Prob Security for comfort, 32 hrs/week, used public transport.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Aftermath</h3>
        <p>Prob Security revealed true colors after a few shifts. Regretted leaving cleaner job. Iron Horse had strict supervision, but Prob was more lenient. Got G2 license, opened new opportunities. Joined Allied Universal (full-time) and Prob (part-time). Left Allied after being caught sleeping. Did dishwasher job after McDonald’s. Repaid car loan in 3 months with Prob and Blackbird Security. Learned not to overshare due to betrayal.</p>
