        <h2>Page 9: Canada Economy and Personal Insights</h2>
        <p>Canada and the economy: Was like import workers low key and see the people feel happy. Difference between skill and non-skill: Nothing one knows and other does not know but skill can be learnt easily. I worked new guy got trained in 1 hr and was ready there is nothing like a skilled or non-skilled guy it is just time spent how much more how much less. Influx of immigrants means less way of life.</p>
        <p>Why probe failed was: Doesn't want to leave cause more Indian people, more travel, do not know schedule, lack of communication, prefer not to talk about hrs and seek help. McD job left due to chances of hate crimes. Mistakes is early decision in panic and less communication with management. Jack of all trades is master of none. Did a lot of research on car buying at time of purchase just bought it completely under someone else influence not doing anything.</p>

        <p>So India has more riches since it needs 5Cr bar to get super rich title or rich title. So apart of upper Indian class is subjected to lower and middle class in Canada if doesn't cross the 107k belt. Need 107k + to live upper middle class in Canada.</p>
        <p>Important control on sex desires: Carving about women white euro and hot Indian chick. Feeling to be loved FOMO validation and I am hot guy syndrome. Too much porn and fap. Other Indian got hot chick why not you are you less worthy.</p>

        <h3>USA Insights</h3>
        <p>It is not that racist who look Indian job market is bad now. It is not a first choice for Indians Tamils south it was Dubai. Green card very long time. Canada is for PR only. Australia New Zealand Germany Italy Portugal Singapore — after they found it is hard to get into these.</p>
        <p>People who have back support and no loans are happy rest all are struggling. Don't get confused between paper money and in hand money. All abroad countries now work on exploitation model. Saudi Arabia big no, no agent, he would make you slave instead.</p>
        <p>Every job in corporate is same. Every official tries to protect or cover his ass and break others. Complain culture is seen in Europe and Spain. Low wage jobs often involve moron. They think they have achieved so much even $21 dollar an hr or manager thinks he is the top boss all like McD ones, no matter which company. Sales booster is loved by all. Learn the art of ass licking be a pro ass licker. Run down on others and be a nice guy in other eyes. Don't think other guy is smart he could be dumber than you think or imagine. No job is hard every job is easy at first it appears to be so hectic then it becomes a cup of tea. I am quick learner and true. You will get only one chance.</p>
        <h3>Women in India</h3>
        <p>Never did a job so no experience whether it is higher pay or low pay job. They are entitled to feel that they have achieved much and are superior because very few girls are in workforce rest are dependant. They achieve little but world tells them they have achieved much. They have to support little to none but have majority to provide.</p>
        <p>So jobs are designed on this way:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Pay less to girls and give high post say HR or a clerk. Reason: Boys have less patience dealing with people and may result in company loss they keep men due to intelligence and vice versa.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Canada in the past was like a good place due to less competition low population and a good shortage of labour. Why hiring is like this: Indian mindset of slavery and doing more work than asked for, abuse of power, toxic culture love. Corporates are always like this. You work 64 hrs a week without good food so must know how to cook.</p>

        <h2>Page 11: Plans in India and Performance</h2>
        <p>After spending 3 weeks, decided to use the money I have brought 4700 CAD to utilize it in good way. I thought of doing:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wifi for 8 months: 700*8 = 6400</li>
            <li>Gym = 600*8 = 4800</li>
            <li>Stock market course purchase = 6000</li>
            <li>AI learning = 20 to 30k course</li>
            <li>French was thought to be done but it proved worthless with time so quit it cause ➖</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Automation coming in whole world first in developed than in developing countries Canada use cheap labor than robot. Job market may collapse. Housing market crash in Canada anytime. Safety is decline and hate crime on rise. PR as well citizenship can be revoked. Reality of dollar is 60 or 54k CAD yearly is equivalent to 60k per month in India. 100k CAD is like 1 lakh per month in India.</p>
        <p>Now it was decided that I will do:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gym for 1.5 hrs</li>
            <li>Stock market 3 hrs</li>
            <li>AI for 8 hrs</li>
            <li>French for 1.5 hrs</li>
            <li>Nofap 0 times a day</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Based on previous performance how will I perform (lets assume)</p>
