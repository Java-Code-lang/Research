            <h2>Population and Success Requirements</h2>
            <p>For a population of 33 crore born from 2000 to 2025, to be in the top 1% you need:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Generational wealth</li>
                <li>Extremely hardworking</li>
                <li>Extremely smart</li>
                <li>Extremely talented</li>
            </ul>
            <p>1% of India is 1.43 crore. 9% of India is 13 crore.</p>
            <p>Must lie in top 3 to win in the present world.</p>
            <p>UK: 6 crore, Canada: 4 crore, Australia: 3 crore — still difficult to live there.</p>
            <p>Even Europe population: 74 crore, average country 2 crore. Literally average population in countries of Europe is only 2 to 3 crore. Biggest country but very less, only 4 crore at max, 3x the size of India.</p>
            <p>India even if 3.8 sq km can easily hold 34 crore or even 50 crore, but it has literally 150 crore.</p>

            <p>Mid and high level: 12 LPA to 30 LPA.</p>

            <h3>India</h3>
            <p>98 hr per week, 14 to 15 hr a day. Salary: 20 to 60k. LPA: 2.4 to 7.2 (Min wage job cycle).</p>

            <h3>Me in Canada</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Wake up at 7 or 10 am</li>
                <li>Sleep or waste time till 3 pm</li>

                <li>8 to 11: do some research and that's it</li>
            </ul>
            <p>India: only 2 to 3 hrs are utilized and whole day is wasted.</p>
            <p>Problems in Canada: Constant fear of being killed, fear of job loss, constant fear of upgrade and sadness to keep working as a security guard, loan and fucked up finances, laziness same like in India, less to little food to eat in Canada.</p>

            <p>Dad married at 30 and I probably came after 3 or 2 years but I can't blame him since his parents are to blame and society Indian is to be blamed.</p>
